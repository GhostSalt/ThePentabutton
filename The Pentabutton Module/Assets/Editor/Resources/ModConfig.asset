  description: 'Oh look, Alchemy''s "Meta" symbol has its own module now!


    As if we needed another "button" module to fill in the gap between square button
    and hexabutton. (oh no)


    As always, TP support included, with colourblind support added as well. (not like
    I could get away without it)'
